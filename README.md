# Time Series Analysis Project – ts-passengers-wind-analysis

This repository contains a project prepared for the course **Time Series Analysis**, carried out as part of university coursework.

## Project Tasks

**Task 1**  
Consider the monthly numbers of passengers (*file dane_RNKM3.csv*).  
Make numbers of passengers forecasts for each month of the first half of 2025.

**Task 2**  
Consider Mateusz’s time series from Lab 1 task 4.2 (i.e., wind speed in Delhi from 1st January 2013 to 1st January 2017).  
- Plot the periodogram. How can a periodogram be used to transform your data?  
- Make all necessary transformations to get a stationary time series (noise).  
- If possible, choose the ARMA (p, q) model for stationary noise.
